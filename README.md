# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use JavaScript to store data in an array or list and create a table that will organize the data. We then will use customizations to create a website so people can see this data and search for specific kinds of information. Lastly, with the use of HTML, Bootstrap and CSS, we are able to read the JavaScript and easily view the website.
## Results
When you first come into the website, this what you see the first time:

### How to search
First thing to do is add what information you want to see. In this case, we will enter tx in the "Enter State". You will see that the data updates to just sightings in tx.
