# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use JavaScript to store data in an array or list and create a table that will organize the data. We then will use customizations to create a website so people can see this data and search for specific kinds of information. Lastly, with the use of HTML, Bootstrap and CSS, we are able to read the JavaScript and easily view the website.
## Results
When you first come into the website, this what you see the first time:

If you scroll down a bit, you will see a bunch of entries and 5 search engines in the "Filter Search" section.

### How to search
First thing to do is add what information you want to see. In this case, we will enter tx in the "Enter State". You will see that the data updates to just sightings in tx.

You can also add more information to narrow down your search. In this case, we will add light to "Enter Shape" and keep tx in "Enter State". You will see the data is narrow down.

You can also delete information and add new information and it will update. We will remove tx from "Enter State" and had a date to "Enter Date". Now it only shows sights that were on 1/13/2010 for shapes for light.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
One drawback of this website is it is case sensitive. If someone were to search for TX, they recieve nothing since all of the states are lowercased. You would have to put tx to find what you are looking for and someone might not know that.
### Recommendations for further developement
- Add customizations that can help guide the user, such as auto-fill or dropdown lists. It takes a lot the guess work out so the user can find exactly what they need.
- Add a tab called "Latest News" so users can see the most current and recent sightings that have happened.
